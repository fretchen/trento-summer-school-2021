# Introduction

Highly controlled experimental platforms like ultracold atoms have profoundly changed our approach to many-body physics over the last twenty years. In this course, we will discuss the experimental tools that enabled this progress and take a deeper look how those tools lead to current efforts on the investigation of lattice gauge theories. The following can be seen as a preliminary guideline for the five day lecture:

## [1. Day -- How we got ultracold](day1)
We will discuss the origins and development of laser cooling techniques as well as the first creation of a Bose-Einstein condensates. These works provide the solid experimental tools for the study of complex many-body systems that we will study the next days.

## [2. Day -- Optical lattices](day2)
The observation of the Mott transition in optical lattice and the BEC-BCS crossover around wide Feshbach resonances established ultracold atoms for the study of strongly correlated systems. We will discuss optical lattices and the Hubbard model and the Mott transition. If we have sufficient time we might take a look into Feshbach-Resonances and the BEC-BCS crossover.

In this tutorial you will have the occasion to take a look into the paper on single site imaging by Sherson et al. {cite}`Sherson2010` as well as {cite}`Bakr2010`

## [3. Day -- Collective spins](day3)
In cold atoms it is possible to implement long collective spins. They are excellent tools for quantum metrology, but also for the emulation of quantum link models. We will discuss how they are experimentally implemented and described.

## [4. Day -- Synthetic gauge fields](day4)
Strong magnetic (gauge) fields are the third pillar of modern many-body physics, and allow for observation the integer and fractional quantum Hall effect. We will discuss the progress that ultracold atomic gases made to implement such fascinating states of matter in bulk systems and optical lattices.

```

## [5. Day -- Dynamical gauge fields](day5)
Finally, the extension of static synthetic gauge fields to dynamical gauge fields would lead the field of ultracold atoms naturally into topics, which were traditionally discussed in high energy systems. We will take a look into these possibilities and challenges within ultracold atoms.
