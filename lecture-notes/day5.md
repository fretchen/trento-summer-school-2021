# Day 5: Opening the route towards high energy physics
Finally, the extension of static synthetic gauge fields to dynamical gauge fields would lead the field of ultracold atoms naturally into topics, which were traditionally discussed in high energy systems. We will take a look into these possibilities and challenges within ultracold atoms.
