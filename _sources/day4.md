# Day 4: Synthetic gauge fields
Strong magnetic (gauge) fields are the third pillar of modern many-body physics, and allow for observation the integer and fractional quantum Hall effect. We will discuss the progress that ultracold atomic gases made to implement such fascinating states of matter in bulk systems and optical lattices.
